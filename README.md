# ![Bulut Bilisimciler](https://github.com/Bulut-Bilisimciler/template/blob/master/assets/EN1-center.png?raw=true)

**This repository provides a scenario template for the Bulut Bilisimciler platform, a community-driven space for learning and collaboration.**

---

The scenario template includes guidelines and prompts to help users structure their scenarios and ensure that they cover all the necessary aspects. The template is flexible and can be used for different types of scenarios, such as CTF, quizzes, or tutorials. It also includes sections for diagrams, code snippets, or other relevant materials that can enhance the scenario's clarity and usefulness.

To use the scenario template, users can clone this repository and edit the template file according to their needs. They can then submit their scenario to the Bulut Bilisimciler platform for review and publication. By contributing scenarios to the platform, users can help build a rich and diverse collection of resources for learning and collaboration.
